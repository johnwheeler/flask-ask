===================================
Program the Amazon Echo with Python
===================================

Flask-Ask is a `Flask extension <http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/>`_ that makes building Alexa skills for the Amazon Echo easier and much more fun.

* `Flask-Ask quickstart on Amazon's Developer Blog <https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx14R0IYYGH3SKT/Flask-Ask-A-New-Python-Framework-for-Rapid-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Development>`_.

The Basics
===============

A Flask-Ask application looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

  from flask import Flask
  from flask_ask import Ask, statement

  app = Flask(__name__)
  ask = Ask(app, '/')

  @ask.intent('HelloIntent')
  def hello(firstname):
      speech_text = "Hello %s" % firstname
      return statement(speech_text).simple_card('Hello', speech_text)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()

In the code above:

#. The ``Ask`` object is created by passing in the Flask application and a route to forward Alexa requests to.
#. The ``intent`` decorator maps ``HelloIntent`` to a view function ``hello``.
#. The intent's ``firstname`` slot is implicitly mapped to ``hello``'s ``firstname`` parameter.
#. Lastly, a builder constructs a spoken response and displays a contextual card in the Alexa smartphone/tablet app.

More code examples are in the `samples <https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask/tree/master/samples>`_ directory.

Jinja Templates
---------------

Since Alexa responses are usually short phrases, you might find it convenient to put them in the same file.
Flask-Ask has a `Jinja template loader <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/api/#loaders>`_ that loads
multiple templates from a single YAML file. For example, here's a template that supports the minimal voice interface
above:

.. code-block:: yaml

    hello: Hello, {{ firstname }}

Templates are stored in a file called `templates.yaml` located in the application root. Checkout the `Tidepooler example <https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask/tree/master/samples/tidepooler>`_ to see why it makes sense to extract speech out of the code and into templates as the number of spoken phrases grow.

Features
===============

Flask-Ask handles the boilerplate, so you can focus on writing clean code. Flask-Ask:

* Has decorators to map Alexa requests and intent slots to view functions
* Helps construct ask and tell responses, reprompts and cards
* Makes session management easy
* Allows for the separation of code and speech through Jinja templates
* Verifies Alexa request signatures

Installation
===============

To install Flask-Ask::

  pip install flask-ask

Deployment
===============

You can deploy using any WSGI compliant framework (uWSGI, Gunicorn). If you haven't deployed a Flask app to production, `checkout flask-live-starter <https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-live-starter>`_.

To deploy on AWS Lambda, use `Zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa>`_. This `blog post <https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/8e8ad73a-99e9-4c0f-a7b3-60f92287b0bf/new-alexa-tutorial-deploy-flask-ask-skills-to-aws-lambda-with-zappa>`_ shows how to deploy Flask-Ask with Zappa from scratch.

Note: When deploying to AWS Lambda with Zappa, make sure you point the Alexa skill to the HTTPS API gateway that Zappa creates, not the Lambda function's ARN.

Development
===============

If you'd like to work from the Flask-Ask source, clone the project and run::

  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

This will install all base requirements from `requirements.txt` as well as requirements needed for running tests from the `tests` directory.

Tests can be run with::

  python setup.py test

Or::

  python -m unittest

To install from your local clone or fork of the project, run::

  python setup.py install
